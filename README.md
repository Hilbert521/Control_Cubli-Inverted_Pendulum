# Control_Cubli-Inverted_Pendulum
Analysis, Implementation, and Simulation of the Cubli 3D Inverted Pendulum

This project addresses the analysis and implementation of the control law proposed in the paper
"Nonlinear Analysis and Control of a Reaction Wheel-based 3D Inverted Pendulum" which allows
the Cubli to maintain balance on a corner. The implementation and simulation animation are setup
using MATLAB.
